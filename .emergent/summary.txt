<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to build the noteall.ru platform. The current active request is to implement a new Suggest Improvements feature.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS for the new feature:
1.  Add a Suggest Improvements button, for example, in the sidebar.
2.  Clicking the button should open a modal window.
3.  The modal should contain a text area for feedback and optional fields for the user's contact information (Telegram and/or email).
4.  When the user clicks Send and the modal closes, the application must take a screenshot of the current page.
5.  The feedback text and the captured screenshot should be sent as a message to a specific Telegram chat via a bot.
6.  The message should also indicate the company and user who sent the feedback.

**User's preferred language**: The user's primary language is **Russian**. The next agent MUST respond in Russian only.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack platform (FastAPI/MongoDB/React). The core storage system, featuring Private, Public, and Trash sections, is now stable after a series of critical bug fixes. Key functionalities include:
-   Folder and project management across Private, Public, and Trash tabs.
-   A complete sharing feature with a user selection UI and cascading permissions (sharing a parent folder correctly shares all its children).
-   A functional trash system that correctly handles items deleted by their owner or by other users from public folders.
-   The folder owner's name is now displayed in the context and dropdown menus for all folders.
-   All previously reported bugs (data leaks, incomplete sharing, cascading permissions, and trash logic) have been resolved and verified.

**Last working item**:
The agent was preparing to implement the Suggest Improvements feature, having just received all the necessary requirements and credentials from the user.
-   Last item agent was working: Kick-off implementation of the Suggest Improvements feature with Telegram bot integration and screenshot capture.
-   Status: NOT STARTED
-   Agent Testing Done: N/A
-   Which testing method agent to use? This is a new feature involving frontend, backend, and a third-party integration. The agent should use a multi-step testing approach:
    1.  **Integration:** First, call  for the  to get the correct installation and usage playbook.
    2.  **Backend:** Create a new backend endpoint to receive feedback, user info, and the screenshot. This endpoint will then call the Telegram API. Test with , initially mocking the screenshot data.
    3.  **Frontend:** Implement the UI (button, modal). For the screenshot, a library like  will be needed. Test the screenshot capture and data submission to the new backend endpoint.
    4.  **E2E:** Once fully implemented, perform a manual end-to-end test: click the button, fill out the modal, submit, and verify that the message with the screenshot appears in the specified Telegram chat.
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs. All previously reported critical issues have been resolved.

**In progress Task List**:
-   Task 1: **Implement Suggest Improvements Feature (P0)**
    -   Description: Build the complete user feedback feature as specified in the original problem statement. This is the current highest priority task requested by the user.

Task Detail:
-   Task 1:
    -   Where to resume: Start by calling  to get the playbook for Telegram bot integration in Python. Then, plan the creation of the backend endpoint and the frontend components.
    -   What will be achieved with this? Users will have a direct channel to provide contextual feedback, including a screenshot, which will help the product owner understand suggestions and bug reports more easily.
    -   Status: NOT STARTED
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both.
    -   Blocked on something: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   There are no other defined upcoming or future tasks. The current focus is solely on the Suggest Improvements feature.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Data Leak Fix:** Resolved the bug where the Public tab incorrectly showed private data. This was fixed by clearing frontend state on tab switch and moving owner name enrichment to the backend. (, , , )
-   **Sharing UI Completion:** Implemented the user selection modal for the sharing feature, making it fully functional. (, , )
-   **Cascading Permissions Fix:** Corrected the sharing logic to ensure that sharing or unsharing a parent folder cascades the visibility change to all its subfolders and projects. (, , )
-   **Trash Functionality Fix:** Fixed a critical bug where items deleted from public folders by non-owners would not appear in the trash. This involved adding a  field and adjusting access control rules. (, , )
-   **Show Folder Owner Feature:** Implemented the user's request to show the folder owner's name in the context and dropdown menus on all tabs. (, , , )

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. All issues reported by the user during this session were addressed and resolved.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate and only task is to build the Suggest Improvements feature as requested by the user.
-   You MUST start by using the  tool to get the correct playbook for .
-   **Telegram Credentials (Provided by user):**
    -   **Bot Token:** 
    -   **Chat ID:** 
-   The feature requires capturing a screenshot. You will likely need to add a frontend dependency (e.g., ) and create a backend endpoint that accepts multipart/form-data to receive the image and then forward it to Telegram.
-   Remember to respond in **Russian**.
