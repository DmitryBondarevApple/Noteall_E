<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to build the noteall.ru platform. Development has progressed through several features:
1.  **Core Features:** Project/folder management (public/private/trash).
2.  **Suggest Improvements Feature:** A feedback modal sending suggestions with optional screenshots to a Telegram chat.
3.  **Admin Dashboards Revamp:**
    *   A detailed analytics page for superadmins to view organization stats.
    *   Replication of the analytics page for the organization admin's own dashboard.
4.  **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   Redesign of the sidebar's lower section for a cleaner look.
    *   Compaction of speaker badges in the transcript view header to save space.
5.  **Password Reset Functionality:** Implementation of a Forgot Password flow using Resend for email delivery.
6.  **Current Issue:** The user has identified that the Forgot Password? link is missing from the authentication modal on the main landing page, even though it exists on the dedicated  page.

**User's preferred language**: The user's primary language is **Russian**. The next agent MUST respond in Russian only.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a stable full-stack platform (React/FastAPI/MongoDB).
-   Core project management, feedback, and admin analytics features are fully implemented and functional.
-   A complete password reset flow is implemented. It uses Resend to email a unique link to the user, allowing them to set a new password. This has been tested and works correctly via the  page.
-   The UI has been recently refined, including a cleaner sidebar layout and more compact speaker badges in the transcript view.

**Last working item**:
The agent just received a bug report from the user about a missing Forgot Password? link.
-   Last item agent was working: The user pointed out via a screenshot that the authentication modal that appears on the main landing page does not have the Forgot Password? link, unlike the dedicated  page. The agent correctly deduced that this modal is a different component from  and was about to locate it.
-   Status: NOT STARTED
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? This is a minor frontend fix. The agent should first locate the correct modal component (likely within a landing page file), add the required link and state logic (similar to ), and then use the  tool to verify the UI change.
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Missing Forgot Password? link in Landing Page Auth Modal (P0)**
    -   Description: The Forgot Password? link is present on the  page but absent from the authentication modal that is triggered from the main landing page.
    -   Attempted fixes: None. The issue was just reported.
    -   Next debug checklist:
        1.  Identify the component file that renders the authentication modal on the landing page. It is NOT . Search the codebase for components that use an authentication modal, likely triggered from a Login or Get Started button.
        2.  Edit the identified component to include the Забыли пароль? (Forgot password?) link and the associated state management to show the password reset form, mirroring the implementation in .
    -   Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This will create a consistent user experience, allowing users to access the password recovery flow from any authentication entry point.
    -   Status: NOT STARTED
    -   Is recurring issue? N
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend.
    -   Blocked on other issue: None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   After fixing the current issue, the agent should ask the user for the next set of tasks. No future tasks have been defined.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, , .
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB aggregation framework.
-   **Email:**  for transactional email delivery.
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based system, now with a secure token-based password reset mechanism.
-   **Code Refactoring:** Common analytics aggregation logic was extracted into a reusable utility module () to support both superadmin and org-admin dashboards. Shared React components were created for the analytics UI.

**key DB schema**
-   No schema changes. The implementation relies on the existing  and  collections.

**All files of reference**
-   **Backend (New/Modified):**
    -   : Added  and  endpoints.
    -   : Refactored to use the new utility.
    -   : Created to house shared analytics logic.
    -   : Added .
    -   : Added  and .
-   **Frontend (New/Modified):**
    -   : Modified to include the forgot password UI and logic.
    -   : Created for the user to enter their new password.
    -   : Added the route for the reset password page.
    -   : Heavily modified for the sidebar redesign.

    -   : New shared components for dashboards.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate and only task is to fix the missing Forgot Password? link in the landing page's authentication modal. This is a high-priority bug for the user.
-   The logic and UI for this already exist in . You need to find the correct modal component and replicate the functionality there.
-   All communication with the user MUST be in **Russian**.

-   **Recharts:** For frontend charting.
-   **html2canvas:** For frontend screenshots.
-   (Existing) OpenAI GPT-4o, Deepgram, AWS S3, Free Currency Converter API.

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: **YES**. Used successfully to validate the org-admin dashboard and the password reset flow.
-   Test files created: None.
-   Known regressions: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   Superadmin user: 
-   Resend API Key: 
-   Resend 'from' email: 

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent successfully implemented the password reset feature as requested. The user then discovered a related but separate UI inconsistency (the missing link in the landing page modal), which was not part of the original scope. The agent did not forget to execute a task, but was interrupted before they could address this newly reported bug.</analysis>
